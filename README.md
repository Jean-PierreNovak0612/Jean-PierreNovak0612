Hi!!

My name is Jean-Pierre and I am a 20 years old self taught web developer. I've been introduced to the web development world in high school, where at first it didn't seem to be very interesting.
However that changed once JavaScript and CSS had been introduced to the big picture. I was slowly starting to apply the knowledge I had about the web and after a year or so I started to develop my web development skills.

Since then three years have passed and I've learned a couple new libraries, as well as a couple new programing language. I currently now how to work with:
- the basics of web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery)
- PHP + MySQL
- React
- Typescript
- Git

All projects I've been working on are awailable here on github, displaying what I am currently able to do.

Some of these project you do not have to clone, since I used GitHub pages to present them, so here are the links to the working projects:
- [Simple app that is using the YouTube v3 api to display and search for some videos](https://jean-pierrenovak0612.github.io/react-yt-api/)
- [A small landing page (on croatian), presenting a little organization for helping animals in need](https://jean-pierrenovak0612.github.io/landing-page/)
- [An e-comerce site that uses the JSON RESTFUL API to display products](https://jean-pierrenovak0612.github.io/ecomerce-site/#/ecomerce-site/ecomerce-site/)

The rest of my projects are still comming.

Currently I am searching for a job in this section and I am also starting my colledge journey, so that I can improve my coding skills.

I still have plenty ideas in my head so be aware that the list of projects will constantly be increasing.
